## [Plasticity function](https://github.com/seabove7/RandomFun/tree/main/Plasticity_function)
This function can calculate principal component distances between samples as a measure of physiological/phenotypic plasticity. This function contains the following items:
* [PCAplast_function.R](https://github.com/seabove7/RandomFun/blob/main/Plasticity_function/PCAplast_function.R): Function code
* [PlasticityFun_example.R](https://github.com/seabove7/RandomFun/blob/main/Plasticity_function/PlasticityFun_example.R): Example code to run the function
* [sample_plot.png](https://github.com/seabove7/RandomFun/blob/main/Plasticity_function/sample_plot.png): Figure of PCA and calculated plasticity  

This function was developed for the following manuscript: [Bove et al. In Prep](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.13.452173v1)
